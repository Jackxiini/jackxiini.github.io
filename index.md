## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Volgenau School of Engineering](https://volgenau.gmu.edu), [George Mason University](https://www.gmu.edu/), advised by Professor [Jessica Lin](https://cs.gmu.edu/~jessica/). I also spent a wonderful time as a Machine Learning Intern at Baidu in 2021, contributing to a computer vision project. I received my B.E. degree in Mechanical Engineering from Shanghai Normal University and M.S. degree in Computer Information Systems from Boston University.

Please email me for the latest CV/resume.

## Research Interests

My research interests lie in **machine learning**, **deep learning**, and **time series data mining**. I focus on developing efficient and accurate deep learning models for **time series classification**, **clustering**, **forecasting**, and **anomaly detection**, in both univariate and multivariate settings. I am also exploring LLM for time series, as well as video anomaly detection and agent-based AI systems. My research also includes **interdisciplinary applications** of time series such as astrophysics, healthcare and cybersecurity, and interpretable machine learning.
